I took the course last year.

I suppose all programming courses I have taken are quite relevant, since they both have given me coding experience, but also expierience with git.

Two years ago I took DH1620 (""human-computer interaction introduction"").
Two years ago I also took SF1924 (""Probability and statistics""). ","I am quite certain I will be somewhere in the industry as a programmer. I don't think I want to start my own company or join some small litlle startup. I don't think I either want to be a consultant. But it is hard to be more specific than that. 

Can't say I have ruled out working with computer games, but I am not sure if that is what I want to do. In fact I am quite open minded, I think I will be satisfied as long as I get to do programming.
